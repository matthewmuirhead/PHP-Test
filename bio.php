  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    I'm Matt, I enjoy making anything faster, whether it be computers, cars or even cats. Making cats go faster is especially funny if you put them on a slippery surface (as demonstrated <a href="#">here</a>).
    I can usually be found buried neck deep in code with a can of coke and some chocolate or on the race track. If I'm not found there then you'd be able to locate me by listening for someone belting out classic hits.
    I drive for a virtual racing team and am the reigning champion of the PTG touring car series on Forza Motorsport 6.
    I like to live life by this quote from Mario Andretti:
 </p>
 <blockquote cite="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13356-if-everything-seems-under-control-you-re-not-going-fast-enough">
   "If everything seems under control, you're not moving fast enough".
 </blockquote>
 <h3>Profession</h3>
 <p>
   I'm a progammer with experience in visual basic and HTML5/CSS3.
   I'm currently a full time student at the University of Northampton studying Computing.
   At the bottom of the main pages and the top of the homepage you will find links to my Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub and Codepen.
   You can check out some of my work there and get in touch with me on those sites.
   Alternatively you can contact me via the contact page <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
